KanbanTool
==========
API Wrapper for the KanbanTool website written in CFML.

#### Setup
To get this working you need to get your domain and token info into auth{}.
Check out the data you get from calling ```infoAccount``` and go from there.

#### Further Reading
There aren't functions here for everything you can do with the API, so feel free to add some!
See [http://kanbantool.com/about/api#introduction] for more information.

#### Error Handling
The kanbanTool component does a little error handling but parsing or connection issues will be thrown.
Obviously, adapt everything to how you best see fit, for your own needs.

#### Feedback
Feel free to share questions/comments.
